### Node JS Microservices with Docker
The project aims at showcasing microservices development best practices in **nodejs** using a simple users and notes microservice
The Project uses docker to cotainerise apps and expose it to the outer world
Docker-compose is used compose the 2 apps and use the configuration

### Microservices architecture using user and notes microservices

### User Microservice

### Notes Microservice

### Interaction between microservices
As an example I have added a few routes in user service to show the routing from users service to notes service

### Exception Handling

### Unit Testing and Integration Testing

### Dockerise using Docker File and Docker Compose
The example app uses docker compose to build and run the docker containers and run 3 apps:]

***users-app***

***notes-app***

***mongo-db***

Use command ***./build.sh*** in root directory to and run the project


### Use different environments(dev, prod) and have different set of ÃŸproperties
